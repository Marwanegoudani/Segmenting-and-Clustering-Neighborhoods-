# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods
In this project, I explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. For this, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need . We scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas data frame so that it is in a structured format.
